The pharmacy starts with a simple and humble beginning.Just after two years, it grows to be a trusted pharmacy offering reasonably priced and quality medicines. The owner said, "I can say that my experience in medicine distribution has affected my desire to pursue establishing a small pharmacy someday". She worked as a distributor of medicines for five years. Working in this field for many years made her realize the unceasing needs of people for medicines. There has been a continuous increase in demands for medicine among people and these demands need to be met. So that the people can get well and lives healthier. Goodness Care Pharmacy, started as a business plan that she made as part of her course requirements. After working as a distributor, She decided to study Business Management. Since owning a pharmacy has always been her dream, she decided to make this the subject of her business plan and eventually she realized that her business plan is slowly falling into place. The challenges brought by the pandemic have drastically affected the business but these did not stop her from achieving her goal of not just establishing her own business
